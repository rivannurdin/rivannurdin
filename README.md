# I'am Rivan ðŸ‘‹
### A passionate Backend Engineer from Indonesia

I am interested in cigarettes. Currently, I work at [Gravitasi](https://www.gravitasi.co.id) and am involved in developing the KMOB Platform. Iâ€™m learning Python (FastAPI) and Node.js (Express.js). I am open to internship or new job opportunities; here is [My Resume](https://github.com/rivannurdin/rivannurdin/blob/main/Rivan%20Nurdin%20Resume%20BackEnd%20Engineer.pdf). I regularly write articles on [Medium](https://rivannurdin.medium.com) and novels or poetry on [Wattpad](https://www.wattpad.com/user/rivannurdin).
